Hi, I'm Chuan Yu. You can also call me Patrick. I have been interested in programming since my second year at Taichung First Senior High School. My favorite fields are CV, NLP, and robotics manipulation learning. My hobbies include cooking, watching movies, and outdoor activities.

As junior in college, I am working on my graduation project and looking for an internship to gain practical experience.
